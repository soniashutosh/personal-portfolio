export const aboutContent = `Welcome to my professional space! I am a proud alumnus of NIT Jaipur, where I earned my degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Presently, I am employed as a Software Development Engineer at Barclays. In my role, I skillfully balance the development of React-based frontends with robust Java-based backends, drawing on two years of intensive experience in the field. 

My technical journey has been rich and varied, highlighted by a research internship during my college days. This opportunity allowed me to delve into deep learning, focusing specifically on creating models for the detection and classification of plant diseasesâ€”a project that not only challenged me but also expanded my understanding of AI's potential applications.

Further refining my skills, I completed an internship at Winglet Technologies, where I developed React applications and engaged extensively with RESTful APIs. My passion for technology extends to a diverse project portfolio, featuring applications in React and AI, utilizing databases such as SQL, Pinecone, and Neon. Additionally, I have gained practical exposure to AWS, enabling me to support and enhance infrastructure as needed.

Through a blend of industry experience and research, I continuously strive to innovate and drive advancements in technology, ensuring I remain at the cutting edge of the field.`;
